 <p>The SVN repository is located at https://github.com/jallib/Jallib.git/trunk/ </p>
 <p>This project holds a set of <strong>JAL libraries</strong>, compatible with JAL V2 (JalV2<a href="/p/jallib/w/edit/JalV2">?</a>) compiler. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAL_%28compiler%29" rel="nofollow">Jal</a> is a high-level language for the Microchip 8-bits PIC microcontrollers (Baseline, Midrange and 18F series). </p>
 <p>Lots of libraries exist, built by authors all over the world. The aim of this project is to: </p>
 <ul>
  <li><i>centralize</i> these libraries </li>
  <li>propose <i>standards</i> to write and share jal code </li>
 </ul>
 <p>This avoids re-inventing the wheel and helps sharing code. </p>
 <p>If you're looking for a specific library, welcome here! You may want to: </p>
