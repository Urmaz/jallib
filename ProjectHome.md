**Downloads**: [Justanotherlanguage.org Downloads](http://justanotherlanguage.org/downloads)

This project holds a set of **JAL libraries**, compatible with JAL V2 (JalV2) compiler. [Jal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAL_%28compiler%29) is a high-level language for the Microchip 8-bits PIC microcontrollers (Baseline, Midrange and 18F series).

Lots of libraries exist, built by authors all over the world. The aim of this project is to:

  * _centralize_ these libraries
  * propose _standards_ to write and share jal code

This avoids re-inventing the wheel and helps sharing code.

If you're looking for a specific library, welcome here! You may want to:

  * [download](http://justanotherlanguage.org/downloads) one of our package.
  * [browse](http://code.google.com/p/jallib/source/browse/) our SVN repository, or [retrieve](SvnRepositoryHowTo.md) sources. Also have a look at UnixCompilingFromSvnHowto, it'll help you to use the whole SVN repository
  * [jalapi](JalapiWelcome.md) is the jallib API documentation.
  * have a look at our [jallib group](http://groups.google.com/group/jallib), where you can get some help.

The SVN repository is organized so you can easily find what you're looking for (libraries, sample programs, device files, etc...). For a complete description, see UnderstandingSvnStructure.

If you plan to contribute, if you dare to put your head over the mowing field, welcome again! Go to the [jallib group](http://groups.google.com/group/jallib) and request to [join us](http://groups.google.com/group/jallib/subscribe), you just need a Google account. We'll be glad to send you a membership invitation! Once registered, you should have a look at our JallibStyleGuide. It will explain know some basic principles, rules, etc... that everyone must obey to provide efficient, understandable code. As a member, have a look at our SvnRepositoryHowTo. You'll be able to access our SVN repository as an official commiter!

Have fun !

The jallib team.
