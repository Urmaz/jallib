
This Jallib package contains a redistribution of the JalV2 compiler.

Executables (binaries):

 * jalv2        : Linux binary
 * jalv2.exe    : Windows binary
 * jalv2ecs.exe : eComStation (OS/2) binary

Other files of the original compiler distribution:

 * decode.txt        : decoding the assembly file
 * jaldiff.txt       : differences between JalV2 and the original Jal language
 * jalopts.txt       : compiler commandline options
 * jalpragm.txt      : pragmas
 * JalV2-manual.html : JalV2 Language User's Guide
 * license.txt       : the JalV2 license
 * readme.asm        : inline assembler
 * readme.txt        : original Readme

Some files of the original compiler package are not re-distributed, in
particular the device files and the file chipdef.jal because Jallib
contains replacements for these files.


Note: These files are not part of jallib, and released under the terms
      and conditions of the JalV2 license, see file 'license.txt'.
