<h1>JalV2 Device Files</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When I started with JAL it struck me that there were so few JALV2 include
files, in particular not for some of my favorite PICmicros (e.g. 16F690,
12F683).
Unfortunately the output of INC2JAL for these chips caused compile-time
errors with my programs (I understood INC2JAL is not up-to-date for JalV2).
Having some experience with scanning MPLAB files (for my Xwisp2 program) I
decided to write a Rexx script to generate a set of include files myself!

<p> The advantages of using a script to generate files are obvious, such as:
<ul>
<li>Creation of device files for all PICmicros available in MPLAB,
automatically updated for new chips and corrections in new versions of
MPLAB.
<li>consistent layout
<li>consistent naming convention
<li>no typing errors
</ul>

<p>The advantages of a standard naming convention are also obvious:
<ul>
<li>Easy migration of a program from one target PICmicro to another.
<li>Same for libraries using this naming convention.
</ul>

<p>This document gives some design and user information about my JalV2
device files.
Apart from the .dev files also the .lkr of MPLab are used.


<h1>The Overall Picture</h1>
<xmp>
                      +----------+   +-----------+
                      | device   |   |  general  |
                      | specific |---|  include  |
                      | include  |   |chipdef.jal|
                      +----------+   +-----------+
                           |
           +---------------+---------------+-------------
           |               |               |
     +----------+    +----------+    +----------+    +---
     | function |    | function |    | function |    |
     | include  |    | include  |    | include  |    | etc
     | 'delay'  |    |  'adc'   |    |  'lcd'   |    |
     +----------+    +----------+    +----------+    +---
</xmp>



<h2>General Include (chipdef.jal)</h1>
<p>The file 'chipdef.jal' which comes with these device files
replaces the file with the same name which comes with the compiler
distribution.
It is included by each of the device files and contains:
<ul>
<li>Constants required by the compiler
<li>Commonly used constants for the device files
</ul>

<p>With the statement 'pragma target chip = .....' in every device file the
compiler assigns a value to the variable 'target_chip'.
The program may reference this variable with a symbolic name.
This symbolic name consists of 'pic_' followed by the type of the PIC.
It makes it possible to use the same source file to generate a hex file
for different types of PICs, as the following example shows:

<xmp>
    include 16f88

    if (target_chip == PIC_16F88) then          -- (not for 16f87)

      ....                                      -- 16F88 unique

    end if
</xmp>

<p>By changing the include statement to 16f87 (or any other) the statements
between 'if' and 'end if' will be skipped by the compiler.

<p>The list of targets in chipdef.jal makes sure that every possible target
name and the corresponding value of target_chip is known by the compiler.
<p>Note: The original chipdef.jal file of the compiler package specifies
different and not all values for 'target_chip' and therefore it
has to be replaced when using this set of include files.

<h2>Device File</h1>
<p>The device specific include files contain:
<ul>
<li>CPU type (12-, 14- or 16-bits core)
<li>Program memory size specification
<li>Data memory (EEPROM) location and size specification
<li>Configuration and ID memory specification.
<li>General Purpose Register (GPR, RAM) location range and sharing.
<li>Special Function Register (SFR) address and mirror adresses, alias names
and bit naming.
<li>Procedures and functions for shadowing of I/O ports.
<li>Symbolic name declarations for configuration bits (fuses).
<li>Some procedures to switch all ports to digital I/O.
</ul>


<h2>Function Include</h2>
<p>Function specific include files have to be included by the program as
required. In most cases these include files require some statements to
couple function specific registers and pins with the device.
See the corresponding libraries and accompanying documentation for
instructions.

<h1>User Information</h2>

<h2>Sample program</h3>

<p>The device files define static device (PICmicro) specific matter.
This allows writing elementary programs, such as for a blinking LED, which
become practically device independent.

<p>The device files are also the base for extensions, such as
libraries for more complicated functions, such as displaying text on an LCD
display or handling analog devices.

<p>Below a simple blink-an-LED program (LED on pin 1 of Port A) for a
PIC16F886 using a 20 MHz resonator. In addition to the device-specific
information obtained from the include file '16f886.jal' some run-time
iformation is needed, like the speed and type of the oscillator and some
other 'environmental' variables. No extra function libraries are required.

<xmp>
-- ------ Blink-an-LED on pin A1 of a PIC16F886 --------

  include 16f886                        -- target is a PIC16F886
                                        -- Notes: - The extension .jal is
                                        --          added by the compiler!
                                        --        - No other includes needed.

  pragma target clock 20_000_000        -- oscillator frequency (in Hz)
                                        -- required for delays

  pragma target OSC         HS          -- high speed external oscillator
  pragma target WDT         Disabled    -- watchdog off
  pragma target MCLR        External    -- external chip reset
  pragma target LVP         Disabled    -- no low voltage programming

  enable_digital_io()                   -- disable analog module(s)

  var volatile bit led           is pin_A1     -- define alias for pin_A1
  var volatile bit led_direction is pin_A1_direction

  led_direction = output                -- make LED-pin output
  forever loop                          -- endless loop
    led = on                            -- there is light!
    _usec_delay(250000)                 -- spin 1/4 seconds
    led = off                           -- flip (on-&gt;off,off-&gt;on)
    _usec_delay(250000)                 -- spin 1/4 seconds
  end loop

</xmp>

<p>When loaded in a 16F886 with 20 MHz resonator or crystal an LED connected
(with series resistor!) to pin 3 (RA1) should blink twice a second.

<h2>Naming conventions for Ports and Pins</h2>

<p>Unfortunately MPLAB of Microchip is not particularly consistent in its
choice of names!
The datasheets and various informational files in MPLAB not infrequently use
different names for the same entity!
Since application programmers are supposed to read the datasheets, the most
obvious would be to use the datasheet names, but these are not part of MPLAB
and would have to be downloaded separately.
And these PDF files are not so easily processed with a script.
So the chosen names are possibly not to what you may be familiar with.

<p>For all registers of the chip a name is defined and where appropriate
also the individual bits or groups of bis are declared.
Also some popular aliases for registers are defined, for example: TMR0IF and
T0IF, TMR0IE and T0IE, etc.

<p>For all ports and port pins a device independent alias is defined and a
similar direction definition, as the following examples show:

<p>For PORTA and TRISA:
<xmp>
  var  volatile  byte  PORTA  at  &lt;addr&gt;
  var            byte  PORTA_low                 -- low order nibble
  var            byte  PORTA_high                -- high order nibble
  var  volatile  bit   pin_A0  at  PORTA : 0
  var  volatile  byte  TRISA  at  &lt;addr&gt;
  var  volatile  byte  PORTA_direction at TRISA
  var  volatile  bit   pin_A0_direction at TRISA : 0
</xmp>
<p>etc. (for all other existing pins and ports)

<p>Similarly for GPIO and TRISIO (with the smaller chips):
<xmp>
  var  volatile  byte  GPIO   at  &lt;addr&gt;
  var  volatile  byte  PORTA  at  GPIO
  var            byte  PORTA_low                -- low order nibble
  var            byte  PORTA_high               -- high order nibble
  var  volatile  bit   pin_A0  at  GPIO : 0
  var  volatile  byte  TRISIO  at &lt;addr&gt;
  var  volatile  byte  TRISA  at  TRISIO
  var  volatile  byte  PORTA_direction at TRISIO
  var  volatile  bit   pin_A0_direction at TRISIO : 0
</xmp>
<p>etc. (for all other existing pins)

<p>Also some procedures and functions are defined to read and set the lower
and upper nibbles of ports and their direction:
<xmp>
  PORTx_low
  PORTx_high
  PORTx_low_direction
  PORTx_high_direction
</xmp>

<p>Notes:
<ol>
<li>When you have used Jal before you may notice some differences in naming
convention:
  <ul>
  <li>PORTA is used consistently, while previously PORT_A was a
      popular naming convention especially for PORT_A_low/high,
      PORT_A_direction, etc.
      For individual pins the convention 'pin_Ax' is maintained.
  <li>Subfields of registers have the registername as prefix, like
      <br>var volatile bit  INTCON_GIE  at INTCON : 7
  </ul>
<li>See the extra alias declarations for the GPIO and TRISIO registers
    and their bits. Programs and function libraries can access the
    GPIO bits with PORTA and pin_Ay names, making it possible to
    use libraries across a large collection of PICmicros.
</ol>

<h2>Special Features</h2>
<p>The device files contain a number of special procedures for the
convenience of a JAL programmer. Most procedures are in the form of a pseudo
variable, some are 'normal' procedures.
Pseudo variables a available for TRISA, TRISB and TRISC and corresponding
pins for the baseline series of PICmicros.
This means for example that
<xmp>
   pin_A2_direction = output
</xmp>
can be used even though these PIC have no TRISA register.

<h2>About Port Shadowing</h2>

<p>Port shadowing is a technique to prevent the Read-Modify-Write problem
with I/O ports of PICmicro's.
This is a problem related to its hardware design and may occur when a read
of a port is immediately followed by writing to that port.
With port shadowing a RAM location is used as replacement for the port.
Reading is done from the port directly. Writing is done to the shadow
register and then its contents flushed to the real port.

<p>With these device files shadowing is automatic, as long
as you use the following names:
<xmp>
  PORTx          - all bits of port x
  PORTx_low      - low order nibble of port x (bits 3..0)
  PORTx_high     - high order nibble of port x (bits 7..4)
  pin_xy         - single bit 'y' of port 'x'
</xmp>
(in which 'x' is a port-letter and 'y' a bit number).

<p>If you want to use other names for pins or nibbles or the whole port you
can specify an alias. For example when you have a red LED connected to pin 0
of PortA, you could specify:
<xmp>
  var  bit led_red is pin_A0
</xmp>
and use 'led_red = on' or 'led_red = off' in your program.

<p>You should avoid direct pin and I/O port manipulation, because it will be
overruled by the automatic shadowing mechanism. For example do not specify:
<xmp>
  var bit led_red at portA : 0
</xmp>

With this specification a 'led-red = on' will have the desired result, but
it will not update the shadow register.
Any next operation which uses the shadowing mechanism will override the
previous direct control operation.

<p>Shadowing is also bypassed when you initialise the alias with the
declaration.
So declaring and initialising an alias as follows:
<xmp>
  var  bit led_red is pin_A0 = off
</xmp>
is bad practice! Initialize an alias separatedly after the declaration.

<h2>Naming convention for configuration bitmasks (fuses)</h1>

<p>The configuration bits or groups of bits is such a large variety that it
is not easy to design a naming convention which covers it all.
The following design rules are used:
<ul>
<li>For all implemented config bits a option name and tags are defined, but:
  <ul>
  <li>duplicate option names may be generated
  <li>duplicate tags may be defined for a single option
  <li>some of the tags may not be acceptable for the compiler
  </ul>
<li>When the compiler stalls over a fuse-def line a manual correction should
  be applied.
<li>For the most popular config bits a 'standard' option name is
defined, along with a 'standard' tag, see the list below.
</ul>

<p>Only for the oscillator specification the MPLAB information files contain
more than 140 different indications!! Because of synonyms this number could
be 'normalized' to a much smaller number!
The first part is the oscillator type, the [optional] second part indicates
secundary functions.
For example it may indicate if the OSC2 pin is CLKOUT or I/O, or if PLL is
active for the 18F series.
Other names may appear when the script could not decipher the description
in the MPLab device file.

<p><b>Notes:</b>
<ol>
<li>In addition to these 'standard' fuse_defs above there may be others,
depending on the features of the specific PICmicro.
Please read the include file to see which fuse-defs are available for your
target PICmicro.
<li>The terms 'Enabled' and 'Disabled' may need to be specified where
usually 'On' and 'Off' are used.
</ol>

<p>When a fuse_def statement causes compile-time error messages you may
simply delete it and specify the fuse-word(s) or -byte(s) explicitly with
bit patterns in stead of using fuse option pragma statements.
For example for the PIC16F690 the following group of statements:
<xmp>
   pragma target OSC       HS
   pragma target WDT       Disabled
   pragma target PWRTE     Enabled
   pragma target MCLR      External
   pragma target CP        Disabled
   pragma target CPD       Disabled
   pragma target BROWNOUT  Enabled
   pragma target IESO      Disabled
   pragma target FCMEN     Disabled
</xmp>
is equivalent with:
<xmp>
   pragma target fuses   0b11_0011_1110_0010
</xmp>

<p>PICs with 16-bits core (the 18F series) have such a large variety of
configuration bits that explicit specification is probably the best way to
make sure all config bits are set correctly for your program.
As an example <p> see the following list for a simple blink-a-LED program
with an 18F242.
<xmp>
  pragma  target fuses 0  0b0000_0000       -- (n/a)
  pragma  target fuses 1  0b0010_0010       -- not switchable, HS osc, no PLL
  pragma  target fuses 2  0b0000_0001       -- BOR disabled, PWTR disabled
  pragma  target fuses 3  0b0000_0000       -- watchdog disabled
  pragma  target fuses 4  0b0000_0000       -- (n/a)
  pragma  target fuses 5  0b0000_0001       -- CCP2 on RC1
  pragma  target fuses 6  0b1000_0001       -- no bg debug, no LVP, STVREN
  pragma  target fuses 7  0b0000_0000       -- (n/a)

<p>Notes:
<ol>
<li>All pragma statements must be specified after the include statement of
the device file.
<li>When a PIC has multiple config words or bytes the index value
of the word or byte should be specified before the value.
<li>The device file contains a fuses specification for the compiler:
how many words/bytes and their corresponding memory addresses.
</ol>

<p>The meaning of config bits can be found in the DataSheet of the specific
PICmicro, or in the Programming Specifications.
For your convenience the MicroChip document numbers are mentioned in the
heading of the device files (when present in the MPlab .dev files!).

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>These device files are part of the central JalV2 repository 'Jallib'
(http://jallib.googlecode.com).
Other libraries of Jallib have been or are being converted to use the names
in these device files.
You are strongly recommended to use only this combination of include files.
Using these device files in combination with other libraries may cause
problems, especially with libraries for the old (pre JalV2) compiler.
<ul>
<li>Bank switching functions are not needed with JalV2 and do not appear in
the device files.
This may cause compile-time errors when using programs or libraries which
still use these procedures.
Please remove these bank switching functions from your programs and
libraries!

<li>The device specific include files are generated from the MPLAB .dev and
.lkr files.
This may cause confusion or even conflicts because the register and bit
names are not always identical to those in the datasheets!
Apart from that MPLAB is not errorfree, consequently include files generated
from this source are not guaranteed errorfree too!

<li>The naming convention of ports and subfields maybe different, you may
have to convert the other libraries.
