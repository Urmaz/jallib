-- Description: this sample show how to use GP2D02 IR ranger library
-- It regularly gets distance measures, and print them back to serial.
-- It also uses a LED to "show" the distance:
--   - when the distance is low (object is closed from the ranger), 
--     the LED will blink very fast
--   - when the distance is high (object is far way from the ranger),
--     the LED will blink very slow
--   - when the distance is to high (nothing detected), the LED is on, no
--     blinking
