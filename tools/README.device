
Device Files of Jallib (http://jallib.googlecode.com)

In Jallib we call the logical layer between the hardware of a specific PIC
and the application program or library a 'device file'. Each device file
contains information for the compiler about hardware (CPU type, amount of
program and data memory, location of Special Function Registers, etc.) and a
number of common control functions (shadowing of I/O ports, controlling
analog/digital mode, etc).

The primary goal of the Jallib device files is to make it possible to build
programs and libraries which are device independent and allow easy migration
of a program from one to another PIC, even from one family to the other.
Therefore we use a strict naming convention and declare aliases for PICs
with 'deviations' in the names as used in the datasheets, for example a
program can use the name PORTA for GPIO of the small PICs.
Of course there are restrictions, for example a program which uses EEPROM
data memory of a PIC will not work on a PIC without EEPROM data memory!

Every Jallib device files includes a common file with definitions of
constants which are common to all PICs and are needed by the JalV2 compiler.
This file 'chipdef_jallib.jal' replaces the file 'chipdef.jal' in the
compiler package.

You can find the device files and chipdef_jallib in the directory 'lib'.
This library should be part of your include specification for the JalV2
compiler (-s option).

For more detailed information about the contents and use of Jallib device
files see: devicefiles.html in the directory 'doc/html'.

For examples of use of device files see the 'blink' directory. You can find
there 'blink-an-LED' samples.

Not all device files have been fully tested yet. We are aware of some
issues with some device files and are continuously working on improvements!
When you encounter a problem you might browse the Jallib repository for
a possibly newer version that solves the problem. If not please inform
us! The most effective way is to report at http://jallib.googlecode.com.
Open 'Issues' to see if there is already a report to which you could add
your comments, or open a new issue.

Have fun!

The Jallib team.
