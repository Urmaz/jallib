# Description: this script takes a HTML file as input, keeps "body" element's content
# and convert some URL to make them compatible with Drupal's. Output is printed in a
# "content" file, in a "topublish" directory, within the one containing original
# HTML files. It also pick used images from orignal "src" location, and put them in 
# an directory (so they are selected and ready for publishing)
