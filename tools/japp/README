This directory contains anything related to JAPP.

(J)allib (A)utomated (P)ublishing (P)rocess is a workflow to automatically
create output document from DITA XML files, and potentially publish them
on justanotherlanguage.org website.

Visit http://justanotherlanguage.org/content/japp for more information.


Scripts in this directory are used to push DITA content to
justanotherlanguage.org website. Several steps:

  - ./dita2html.sh /abs/path/to/file.xml output_dir
      convert DITA file to full HTML (headers, body,...).
      Requires DITA to be fully working (run $DITA_HOME/startcmd.sh before)
      Careful: if output_dir is relative, results will be in $DITA_HOME/output_dir,
      not in directory from where you run the script

  - python htmlizer.py config.py output_dir/file.html
      prepare HTML for website publication (remove headers, convert links and
      img elements...). config.py is the configuration file, created from 
      japp_config.py.tpl. Read comments in this file for more.
      Creates a output_dir/topublish directory, containing everything ready to be
      published.

   - python publish.py config.py output_dir/topublish
      actually glue topublish content into an email. This emails is sent to the
      declared recipient address in config file. This address is regurlarly polled 
      by justanotherlanguage.org so emails are transformed into Drupal nodes.

   - cat filelist | ./japp.sh config.py
      automatically publish all DITA files declared in filelist. In JAPP, TOPUBLISH
      is used to produced filelist and select files that have changed during commits.
