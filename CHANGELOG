jallib-0.1: 
----------

Released on 2009-01-02

Changes since 0.1beta:

general:
 - libraries are licensed under the ZLIB license
 - jallib-pack: jallib released with JalV2 compiler binaries for several
   platforms, and with its documentation
 - samples are now prefixed by PIC's name
 - script to reindent jal code
 - documentation: links to samples now point to local files

device files:
 - some new device files
 - all updated with the latest MPlab version (8.15) info
 - fixed shared/unshared memory of midrange PICs
 - enhanced default fuse settings of 18F series

peripherals:
 - pic_data_eeprom.jal: now handles larger EEPROMs with 18Fs (more than 256
   bytes), pragma inline optimizations
 - i2c_software.jal: to write i2c software master
 - i2c_hardware.jal: to write i2c hardware master
 - i2c_level1.jal: high-level i2c library, for both soft & hardware libs

jal extension:
 - format.jal: added format_time_hms()
 - calendar.jal library
 - rtc_isr_tmr0.jal: real-time clock ISR library

externals:
 - humidity_sht.jal: humidity sensor library (SHTxx sensors)
 - temperature_tc77.jal: temperature sensor library (TC77 sensor)
 - co2_t6603.jal: co2 sensor library (T6603 CO2 sensor)
 - keyboard.jal: keyboard library
 - lcd_hd44780_8.jal: added 8-bits LCD library

samples
 - added samples for all new or fixed libraries
 - 16f88: fixed internal clock configuration
