jallib-0.4.0:
------------

Released 2009-08-16

Changes since 0.3

device files:
 - based on MPLAB version 8.33, new device files for
   12F520, 18F66J93, 18F67J93, 18F86J93, 18F87J93, 18F87K22, 18F87K90.
 - added:
   + pin-aliases with help of /tools/pinmap_pinsuffix.json.
   + enumeration of bitfield VCFG of ADCON0 and ADCON1 registers
   + const byte ADC_NTOTAL_CHANNEL = <#>  (number of of ADC channels),
   + const byte[] PICTYPE, DATASHEET and PGMSPEC (without letter suffixes)
   + const word DEVICE_ID
   + pseudo variable ADCON0_CHS for 16F7x7 with 'splitted' CHS bits.
   + declaration for pin_A3,1,0 to 18F13/14K50 and their LF variants.
 - removed:
   - fuse_def statements for ENICPORT and for some unsupported bits
     of the 18Fs (protection bits of not present code/data/write memory).
 - fixed:
   * declaration of SFRs of 18Fs: only SFRs above
     0xF00+AccessBankSplitOffset are declared 'shared'.
   * 12F519: registers renamed: PORTB -> GPIO/PORTA, TRISB -> TRISIO;
     T0CS bit setting added to enable_digital_io(), flash-data -> EEPROM.
   * 12F526: fixed missing bit fields of EECON.
   * ANSEL of 12F609, 12HV609, 16F610, and 16HV610 rehabilitated
     (these chips have no ADC, but do have an analog comparator).
   * pragma code for 16-bits core specified in bytes (was words)
   * 'bit*4 PS' of T0CON (16F72x) splitted into 'bit PSA' and 'bit*3 PS'
 - other changes:
   * replaced '<type> var ... is  ...'  by  'alias ... is ...' (JalV2.4l)
   * normalized ANSx subfields of ANSELx and ADCONx to JANSEL_ANSx naming.
   * bit TxSYNC in TxCON register normalized to NTxSYNC for:
     T1CON of baseline and midrange and T1CON,T3CON and T5CON of 18F series.
   * Normalized TxCON_TOUTPS to TxCON_TxOUTPS for 18Fs
   * ADCONx_[P]VCFG now both declared as multi-bit field and as enumerated bits.
   * fuse_def OSC now handled by table (/tools/fusedefmap.cmd)
   * minor changes in output formatting (for html doc generation).
