jallib-next:
-----------

device files:
 - Based on MPlab version 8.33, new device files for:
   12F520, 18F66J93, 18F67J93, 18F86J93, 18F87J93, 18F87K22, 18F87K90.
 - Added pin-aliases with the help of contents /tools/pinmap.py file.
 - Normalized ANSx subfields of ANSELx and ADCONx to JANSEL_ANSx naming.
 - Added enumeration of bitfield VCFG of ADCON0 and ADCON1.
 - ADCONx_[P]VCFG now both as multi-bit field as enumerated bits.
 - ANSEL of 12F609, 12HV609, 16F610, and 16HV610 rehabilitated.
   These chips have no ADC, but do have an analog comparator!
 - Fix for declaration of SFRs of 18Fs: only SFRs above
   0xF00+AccessBankSplitOffset are declared 'shared'.
 - Several corrections for 12F519: PORTB -> GPIO/PORTA, TRISB -> TRISIO,
   controlling T0CS bit in enable_digital_io(), flash-data -> EEPROM.
 - Added pseudo variable ADCON0_CHS for 16F7x7 with 'splitted' CHS bits.
 - Added declaration of pin_A3,1,0 to 18F13/14K50 and their LF variants.
 - Removed fuse_def statements for ENICPORT and for some unsupported bits
   of the 18Fs (protection bits of not present code/data/write memory).
 - Added: const byte ADC_NTOTAL_CHANNEL = <number> (of ADC channels)
 - Minor changes in output formatting (for html doc generation).

jallib-0.3.0:
------------

device files:
 - added tested device file 16f84a
 - changed name OSCCON_IOSCF to OSCCON_IRCF for 16F690 and
   10 others, and name OSCCON_IRFC to OSCCON_IRCF for 16F88x group
 - fixed NMMRs of 12-bits core: multi-bit bit fields now declared
   as bit*<number>  (was byte)
 - extended and improved documentation file 'devicefiles.html'
 - bug fix PORTx'get and pin_xy'get of 18Fs (read PORTx, was LATx).

externals:
 - lcd_hd44780_4/8 refactored (API changes, see deprecation warnings)
 - write-timing now CPU speed independent
 - infra-red GP2D02 distance ranger library

peripherals:
 - serial_hw_int_cts: add deprecation warnings
 - pwm libraries: shadow registers initialized to 0
   (so libs are compatible with Enhanced-PWM). Fixed pwm_off() turning
   pwm on when called twice.
 - added USB libraries

jal extension:
 - jascii: added 'tolower' procedure

samples:
 - corrected existing samples for refactored lcd_hd44780 libraries
 - removed some obsolete samples and added new samples for refactored
   lcd_hd44780 libraries
 - added 16f84a_blink sample
 - added pic18f4550 / pic18f2450 samples
 - added new USB samples (HID mouse, HID Generic, USB Serial)
 - added new GP2D02 distance ranger sample

compiler:
 - replaced by version 2.4k, see file README.txt of compiler for details

project:
 - Added lcd_interface application (hardware design, software). Provides access
  to an hd44780 lcd trough lcd_hd44780_serial_sw.jal and a single IO pin.


jallib-0.2:
-----------

device files:
 - corrected program memory specifications for 18Fs
 - normalized MSSP register names
 - generated with MPLAB 8.20
 - corrected several fuse_def definitions

peripherals:
 - pwm_hardware.jal: new uniform PWM API. Whatever the number
   of PWM channels for a given PIC, include appropriate underlying libs.
 - adc_hardware.jal: now handles 8-bits only resolution ADC
 - i2c: i2c hardware slave library, ISR and message interface
 - serial_hardware with interrupt now also has same API as serial_hardware
   without interrupt.

jal extension:
 - random.jal - high-quality random with classic API

samples:
 - several i2c hardware master/slave samples

----------

Released on 2009-01-02

Changes since 0.1beta:

general:
 - libraries are licensed under the ZLIB license
 - jallib-pack: jallib released with JalV2 compiler binaries for several
   platforms, and with its documentation
