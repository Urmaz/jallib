jallib-0.3.0:
------------

device files:
 - added tested device file 16f84a
 - changed name OSCCON_IOSCF to OSCCON_IRCF for 16F690 and
   10 others, and name OSCCON_IRFC to OSCCON_IRCF for 16F88x group
 - fixed NMMRs of 12-bits core: multi-bit bit fields now declared
   as bit*<number>  (was byte)
 - extended and improved documentation file 'devicefiles.html'
 - bug fix PORTx'get and pin_xy'get of 18Fs (read PORTx, was LATx).

externals:
 - lcd_hd44780_4/8 refactored (API changes, see deprecation warnings)
 - write-timing now CPU speed independent
 - infra-red GP2D02 distance ranger library

peripherals:
 - serial_hw_int_cts: add deprecation warnings
 - pwm libraries: shadow registers initialized to 0
   (so libs are compatible with Enhanced-PWM). Fixed pwm_off() turning
   pwm on when called twice.
 - added USB libraries

jal extension:
 - jascii: added 'tolower' procedure

samples:
 - corrected existing samples for refactored lcd_hd44780 libraries
 - removed some obsolete samples and added new samples for refactored
   lcd_hd44780 libraries
 - added 16f84a_blink sample
 - added pic18f4550 / pic18f2450 samples
 - added new USB samples (HID mouse, HID Generic, USB Serial)
 - added new GP2D02 distance ranger sample

compiler:
 - replaced by version 2.4k, see file README.txt of compiler for details

project:
 - Added lcd_interface application (hardware design, software). Provides access
  to an hd44780 lcd trough lcd_hd44780_serial_sw.jal and a single IO pin.


jallib-0.2:
-----------

device files:
 - corrected program memory specifications for 18Fs
 - normalized MSSP register names
 - generated with MPLAB 8.20
 - corrected several fuse_def definitions

peripherals:
 - pwm_hardware.jal: new uniform PWM API. Whatever the number
   of PWM channels for a given PIC, include appropriate underlying libs.
 - adc_hardware.jal: now handles 8-bits only resolution ADC
 - i2c: i2c hardware slave library, ISR and message interface
 - serial_hardware with interrupt now also has same API as serial_hardware
   without interrupt.

jal extension:
 - random.jal - high-quality random with classic API

samples:
 - several i2c hardware master/slave samples


jallib-0.1:
----------

Released on 2009-01-02

Changes since 0.1beta:

general:
 - libraries are licensed under the ZLIB license
 - jallib-pack: jallib released with JalV2 compiler binaries for several
   platforms, and with its documentation
 - samples are now prefixed by PIC's name
 - script to reindent jal code
 - documentation: links to samples now point to local files

device files:
 - some new device files
 - all updated with the latest MPlab version (8.15) info
 - fixed shared/unshared memory of midrange PICs
 - enhanced default fuse settings of 18F series

peripherals:
 - pic_data_eeprom.jal: now handles larger EEPROMs with 18Fs (more than 256
   bytes), pragma inline optimizations
 - i2c_software.jal: to write i2c software master
 - i2c_hardware.jal: to write i2c hardware master
 - i2c_level1.jal: high-level i2c library, for both soft & hardware libs

jal extension:
 - format.jal: added format_time_hms()
 - calendar.jal library
 - rtc_isr_tmr0.jal: real-time clock ISR library

externals:
 - humidity_sht.jal: humidity sensor library (SHTxx sensors)
 - temperature_tc77.jal: temperature sensor library (TC77 sensor)
 - co2_t6603.jal: co2 sensor library (T6603 CO2 sensor)
 - keyboard.jal: keyboard library
 - lcd_hd44780_8.jal: added 8-bits LCD library

samples
 - added samples for all new or fixed libraries
 - 16f88: fixed internal clock configuration
