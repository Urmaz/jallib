test setup overview
===================

Upfront: 
   these batchfiles are specific to my (JS) setup of
   compiler, programmer etc. and should be made more generic.

This directory contains a setup for automated testing of JAT. 

The basis of the tests are testxxx.jal files. Reference files are created for
each of them by running the code on a pic target and capture the output. For this,
the JAL code contains a loop that is run 10 times, so timing is not too critical. 
The capture program filters exactly one run and saves this. These reference files
are used as 'output prediction' for the JAT tests.

A JATtest consists of translate & run (on the pc) of testxxx.jal and a compare of 
the output to the reference.    
For automated testing of JAT code on embedded targets, a modified version of reftest 
could be used

   
reftest test001
   compiles test001.jal for the pic target, programs it into a pic,
   captures the ouput and stores this into a file called test001.ref

reftest 
   Called without a parameter, this script executes reftest for all files 
   (maintain list within this batchfile).
   
jattest test001
   translates test001.jal to c, compiles it and runs it on the PC.
   The output is captured and compared to the reference.
   test.dif contains the differences.
 
jattest 
   Called without a parameter, this script executes jattest for all files 
   (maintain list within this batchfile here too).

clean
   removes all temporary files *and* JAT test results. REF remains.
