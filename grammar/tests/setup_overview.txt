test setup overview
===================

Upfront: 
   these batchfiles are specific to my (JS) setup of
   compiler, programmer etc. and should be made more generic.

The basis of the tests are testxxx.jal files. Reference files are created for
each of them by running the code on a pic target and capture the output.
A JATtest consists of translate & run (on the pc) of testxxx.jal and compare the
output to the reference.

reftest test001
   compiles test001.jal for the pic target, programs it into a pic,
   captures the ouput and stores this into a file called test001.ref

reftest 
   calls reftest for all files (maintain list within this batchfile).
   
jattest test001
   translates test001.jal to c, compiles it and runs it on the PC.
   The output is captured and compared to the reference.
   test.dif contains the differences.
 
jattest 
   calls jattest for all files (maintain list within this batchfile here too).

clean
   removes all temporary files *and* JAT test results. REF remains.
