20100920 bugreport

I'm not sure what's going on but this is what I see:

from code in adc_channels:
   ADCON1_PCFG = no_vref  ;; here it is

   serial_hw_data = "#"
	print_byte_hex(serial_hw_data, ADC_PCFG_MAP[idx])
   serial_hw_data = "_"
	print_word_hex(serial_hw_data, no_vref)

Gives as ouput:
#09_DC0C                    
so one would say that there's something wrong with the assignement:
   ADCON1_PCFG = no_vref  ;; here it is

But interesting is the waring:
    adc_channels.jal:2627: warning: assignment to smaller type; truncation possible
on 
	print_word_hex(serial_hw_data, no_vref)
which implies no_vref is larger than a word, while it is defined at line 422 as
   var bit*4 no_vref = 0
 
 And when I reduce the program size, the problem seems to disappear.
