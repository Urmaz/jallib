jal bugreport 20100405

A variable is removed by the optimiser while it should not.

It is a pretty large program, since simplification seems to remove the bug condition.

Compile it with line 10 of gps_converter as:

   var volatile byte GpsMsgNr;         ; ID of current message

and the program works like expected.
However, removing 'volatile' makes it fail. For some reason, the compiler removes the 
assignment of GpsMsgNr on line 146 and changes line 149
   print_byte_dec(serial_hw_data, GpsMsgNr) 
into 
   print_byte_dec(serial_hw_data, 0)
