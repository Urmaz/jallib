Bugreport: 
There seems to be something wrong when a variable is declared within the program.
In wrong tank.jal, variable 'temp' is defined at line 100. This makes the print
statements at line 132 and 134 fail, in the way that the values printed are not 
correct and often 65535, 39, 29.

in okay tank.jal, temp is declared at line 69 and this program works as expected.
