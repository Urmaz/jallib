20100206 updated: fixed in 2.4n -- 2 June 2010

20100526 - array passing fixed in beta compiler version of today!

the new compiler: 
; compiler: jal 2.4n-beta (compiled May 21 2010)

does blink a led. However, if a const string is printed in the loop, it fails to print 
this string *and* does not blink the led any more either.

An other thing is error reporting: 
include 16f877a 
does_not_exist = 0

triggers a tag-dump of more than 1000 lines (without the debug option).
