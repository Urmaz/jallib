	<b>Description</b>
	<p>
		<pre>This library provides a simple switch debounce function.
.
Quite often, when monitoring the state of a mechanical switch, it is
necessary to take switch bounce into consideration. Rather than going
straight from one stable state to another, it can take a significant
period during which the contacts of the switch bounce together. If
you don't take this into consideration then, rather than receiving
a single pulse, your sofware can end up seeing a sequence of many
pulses.
.
In an ideal world without switch bounce, perhaps you'd like to have the
following:
.
forever loop
  if (pin_a0 == true) then
     -- do some stuff
  end if
  -- do some other stuff
end loop
.
This library tries to make it possible to do this while handling
switch bounce for you. At its simplest, you could do the following:
.
var word state = debounce_init(200)
forever loop
  if (debounce(pin_a0, state) == 1) then
     -- do some stuff
  end if
  -- do some other stuff
end loop
.
In the example above, the lowest bit returned by the debounce function
will only flip after pin_a0's state has been polled in a stable state
200 times in a row. Choosing the threshold (200 in this case) is probably
matter of trial and error - it'll depend on the characteristics of the
switch you're using and how quickly your polling loop runs.
.
You must allocate a word to hold the bounce state, threshold and counter,
and initialise it using debounce_init (as above). The maximum threshold
value you can specify is 255, and the value is only stored with a
resolution of 6 bits. All threshold values are ORed with 0b11, so
specifying a threshold value of 9, for example, will give an actual
threshold value of 11. This may sound a bit odd, but it's so the bottom 2
bits of the status word can be stolen and used for storing internal
state. The actual counter uses the full 8 bits.
.
The debounce function also returns a second bit, which is set only when
the returned state has just changed. This is useful if you want something
to happen just once when a button is pressed, for example.
.
  if (debounce(pin_a0, state) == 3) then
      -- do some stuff
  end if
.
The returned values are as follows then:
.
    0b00 =  0   - Input is stable at 0 and has not just changed
    0b01 =  1   - Input is stable at 1 and has not just changed
    0b10 =  2   - Input is stable at 0 and has just changed from 1
    0b11 =  3   - Input it stable at 1 and has just changed from 0
.
Here is a full list of all functions:
.
function debounce_init(byte in threshold) return word
.
   This is used to initialise a state variable ready for use.
   threshold is the number of calls after which the debounce
   function should consider a new state stable.
.
function debounce(bit in polled, word in out state) return byte
.
   This is the main function - I'm not going to go into detail here as
   it's described above.
.
function debounce_fast(bit in polled, word in out state) return byte
.
   You may have noticed that debounce() imposes a lag while it decides
   whether the new state is stable. If it's critical that you respond
   immediately to a state change, you can use debounce_fast instead. This
   one is used in exactly the same way as debounce(), but rather than
   waiting for a stable state, it assumes that a changed state is going
   to stabilise to that changed state. So it flips its return value
   immediately on detecting a state change. Then, it embargoes further
   state changes until the threshold period has passed.
.
   The downside of this is that if your input data sometimes receives
   spurious short pulses that you'd like to ignore, debounce_fast will
   act on them, turning them into longer pulses.
.
function debounce_state(word in state) return byte
.
   This returns the last value that was returned by debounce for this
   state variable.
.
function debounce_just_changed(word in state) return bit
.
   This returns the last "just changed" flag that was returned by
   debounce for this state variable.
.
function debounce_stable_state(word in state) return bit
.
   This returns the last stable state that was returned by
   debounce for this state variable.
.
function debounce_threshold(word in state) return byte is
.
   This returns the threshold value that's in use in this
   state variable.
