      <title>File Includes</title>
      <p>An include causes the content of the included file to be read. A duplicate include with the same name will be ignored, this makes it possible for a library file to include all required lower libraries.</p>
      <p>Includes are seen first in the current directory, and next in each location indicated by the compilers search path. All JALv2 files have the extension &quot;.JAL&quot;. Do not put this extension in the include statement.</p>
      <p><b>Example:</b></p>
      <codeblock>include serial  -- includes file named serial.jal
include print -- includes file named print.jal
</codeblock>
