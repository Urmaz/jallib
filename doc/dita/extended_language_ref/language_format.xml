      <title>Intro to JALv2/Jallib code format</title>
      <p>The JALv2 language is  free-format (there is no separator character between lines), and is not case-sensitive. All characters
with an ASCII value below the space (tab, carriage return, new line, form feed, etc.) are treated
as spaces, except that the end of a line terminates a comment.</p>
      <p>Although JALv2 is not case sensitive, it is a good idea to keep some consistency in your writing. Jallib has come up with a &quot;Style Guide&quot; which basically involves all lower case, with &quot;_&quot; characters between words in variables. An example of a variable would be in the form: hello_world</p>
      <p>Jallib also specifies that 3 spaces should be used for indenting.</p>
      <p>You may read more about the Jallib Style Guide here: <xref href="http://www.justanotherlanguage.org/content/jsg" format="html">http://www.justanotherlanguage.org/content/jsg</xref></p>
      <p>Here&apos;s a short code example:</p>
      <codeblock>-- if statement in preferred format
if hello_a &gt; hello_b then
   hello_a = hello_b + 1
else
   hello_a = hello_b - 1
end if

-- but this has exactly the same effect
if hello_a &gt; hello_b then hello_a = hello_b + 1 else hello_a = hello_b - 1 end if
</codeblock>
