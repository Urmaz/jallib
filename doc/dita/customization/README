This directory contains XSL (HTML/FO) customization for jallib.
These files were taken from DITA-OT (version 1.5 M21), and customized
following their customization guideline.

  "demo" contains XSL-FO customization for PDF creation
  "xsl/xslhtml" contains XSL-HTML customization for HTML creation


In order to deploy this customization, get DITA-OT version 1.5-M21.
You'll get a "DITA-OT1.5". Now into parent directory containing this DITA-OT1.5
directory, and checkout these customization:

$ svn co --force https://jallib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/dita/customization DITA-OT1.5

Using --force option will make SVN checkout sources even if unversioned directories exist.
(this is what we want)
