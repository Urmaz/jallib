      <p><ol>
          <li>You may program your PIC while it is in your breadboard circuit</li>
          <li>You may program your PIC while it is on a soldered circuit board</li>
          <li>You will save time programming so you can write more code faster</li>
          <li>You can reset your circuit from your PC</li>
          <li>You can program surface mount PIC&apos;s that are on soldered circuit board</li>
          <li>You won&apos;t bend or break any pins</li>
          <li>You won&apos;t damage your PIC by placing it in your breadboard wrong</li>
          <li>With a remote desktop software like VNC, you can program your PIC from anywhere around the world. </li>
          <li>I can program my PIC in my livingroom on my laptop while I watch tv with my wife! (I keep my mess in my office)</li>

      <title>Intro to ICSP &amp; in-circuit programming</title>
      <p>When I got started in micro-controllers and JAL, I needed to choose a programmer. At the time, I did not know anything about choosing a programmer, so I just went on ebay and bought one that is able to program many different PIC&apos;s.</p>
      <p>For years, I used this programmer by putting my 16f877 chip into it, programming it, and putting it into my circuit. I broke pins and wasted a lot of time. Little did I know, my programmer has an ICSP output for in-circuit programming. My programmer even says ICSP on it, but I did not know what ICSP is.</p>
      <p>Eventually I got sick and tired of moving my micro-controller back and forth from the breadboard to the programmer, and I had herd some talk about ICSP. I found a ICSP circuit on the net, and I took a harder look at my programmer, it has 6 pins sticking up labeled ICSP. However, I did not know what pin was what, they where not marked well, and I could not find info about my programmer. One of the pins was marked pin 1 on the programmer. If you know your ICSP pinouts already, you may skip to the circuit diagram.</p>
      <p>I searched for 6-pin ICSP in Google with no results, mostly I found 5 pin circuits. So, I took out my volt-meter and logic probe (and oscilloscope, although it is not needed) and measured the voltages off each pin while programming a chip and while not. I could see on the breadboard that pin 6 is connected to ground. Here&apos;s what I got:</p>

      <title>Get the pin names</title>
      <p>The pin names for ICSP are VPP1, LOW, DATA, CLK, VCC, GND. So lets match them up:</p>
      <p>0v pin 2 must be pin “GND”, I think this one is actually not connected</p>
      <p>0v pin 6 must be pin “GND”</p>
      <p>pin 1 &amp; 5 seem to be programming enable pins, VPP1 and VCC</p>
      <p>The two pulsing pins must be “CLK” and “DATA” (you may have to guess which is which if you don&apos;t have a oscilloscope.</p>
      <p>Lets make a new chart. I believe most ICSP ports have pins in this order:</p>

      <title>Build a circuit with ICSP</title>
      <p>VCC can be connected to your PIC’s 5v supply for power-off programming. It does not work on my circuit because there is too much current drain. Do not connect both VCC directly to your power supply since there may be a voltage difference. In my circuit, I will not use the VCC pin, and I will program my chips while my circuit power supply is ON</p>
      <p>GND must be connected to your circuits ground. Follow this circuit diagram:</p>
